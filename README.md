# PHP Project Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run a PHP project locally using XAMPP. XAMPP is a popular development environment that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and other tools.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html): Download and install XAMPP based on your operating system.

## Getting Started

1. **Install XAMPP:**
   - Download the XAMPP installer for your OS from the official website.
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - Start the Apache and MySQL services from the XAMPP control panel.

2. **Clone the Project:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project.
   - Clone the project repository using Git:
     ```
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```

3. **Configure Apache:**
   - Open the XAMPP control panel.
   - Click the "Config" button for Apache.
   - Select "httpd.conf" to edit the Apache configuration file.
   - Locate the `DocumentRoot` directive and set it to the directory path of your project:
     ```
     DocumentRoot "path/to/your/project"
     ```
   - Save the configuration file and restart Apache.

4. **Create a Database:**
   - Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
   - Click "Databases" and create a new database for your project.

5. **Configure Database Connection:**
   - In your project directory, locate the configuration file (e.g., `config.php`) that contains database connection details.
   - Update the database host, username, password, and database name to match your XAMPP configuration.

6. **Access Your Project:**
   - Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost` or `http://localhost/your_project_directory`.

## Running the Project

Your PHP project should now be up and running locally. You can access it through your web browser using the specified URL. Make sure you import any required database tables and data into your local database.
